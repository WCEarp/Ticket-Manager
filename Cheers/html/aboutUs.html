        <p>
            For our project, we have been tasked by organizations that manage shows at the Civic
            Center Concert Hall and Civic Center Playhouse to create a ticket management software that
            they can use to run events as well as an interface that customers may use to buy tickets to
            events. The goals of this software given by the organizations is for it to be easily used by
            volunteers, easily used by multiple groups, and allow for easy manipulation of seating and
            seating policies. The system will also be used by customers and therefore will need an interface
            for customers to buy tickets. Another feature that the software will have to manage are season
            ticket holders as well as a special way of reserving tickets in a tiered customer system. At the
            end of this project, we will have created software that will be used by multiple organizations to
            manage their events as well as support the users and customers that will buy tickets to their
            shows. The software will feature a pick your seat on the map functionality and will store all
            appropriate data that is needed.
